> Truthiness

* a boolean is an object whose only purpose is to convey whether it is "true" or "false"
* when it comes to || or && operators as soon as the operator can guarantee the return value it stops evaluating the expression which is called **short circuiting**.
* Everything in Ruby is considered "truthy" excpet for false and nil.
