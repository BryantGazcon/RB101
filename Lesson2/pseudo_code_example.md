# write out pseudo code(casual/ formal)

### A method that returns the sum of two integers

## Casual:

 Set two parameters for method
 
 Pass in two numbers as arguments
 
 sum of both numbers
 
 return value by invoking puts

## Formal:

START

def sum(x,y)
x + y
end

PRINT sum(x,y)

END


### a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

## Casual:

Given array of strings

define method w/parameters

separate strings

add strings together

## Formal:
START

Given array with strings 

define method to pass in array as argument

flatten array then split each string

add all strings together

END


###  a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. 

## Casual: 

Given array of integers

define method w/parameter

Select values from array if index odd

## Formal:

Given array of integers

Define method w/parameter equal to array

array.map IF index is odd

END

###  method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

## Casual:

given string of characters

determine how many times character appears in string

on third appearance return index

if character does not occur 3 times return nil

## Formal:

START

Given string of characters and character to find

split string by character

IF character in string on 3rd appearance, puts index value

ELSE return nil

END

### a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes.


## Casual: 
 
 given two arrays of numbers

 merge second array into first array at odd indexes of first array

 

## Formal:

given two arrays of numbers


merge second array into first array at odd indexes of first array

end

(Not sure where to even start for this problem)
