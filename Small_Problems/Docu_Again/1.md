> Class and Instance Methods
#### Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?

* Both methods can be found on [documentation page](https://ruby-doc.org/2.7.7/File.html#method-c-path) for file in core API section. File :: path is a class method whereas File#path is an instance method.
* Class methods are called on the class, while instance methods are called on objects
* puts File.path('bin') calls the class method File :: Path since we're calling it on the File class
* f = File.new('my-file.txt')

  puts f.path 
  
  calls the instance method File#path since we're calling it on an object of the File class namely f.
